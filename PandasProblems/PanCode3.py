'''An empty DataFrame in pandas is a table with no data but can have defined column names and indexes. 
It is useful for setting up a structure before adding data dynamically. An empty DataFrame can be created 
just by calling a dataframe constructor.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame()
print(df)
