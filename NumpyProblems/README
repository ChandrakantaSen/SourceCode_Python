-- NumPy stands for numeric python which is a python package for the computation and processing of the multidimensional and single dimensional array elements.

-- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python. It is commonly referred to multidimensional container that holds the same data type. It is the core data structure of the NumPy library and is optimized for numerical and scientific computation in Python.

-- Travis Oliphant created NumPy package in 2005 by injecting the features of the ancestor module Numeric into another module Numarray.

-- It is an extension module of Python which is mostly written in C. It provides various functions which are capable of performing the numeric computations with a high speed.

-- There are the following advantages of using NumPy for data analysis.
----> NumPy performs array-oriented computing.
----> It efficiently implements the multidimensional arrays.
----> It performs scientific computations.
----> It is capable of performing Fourier Transform and reshaping the data stored in multidimensional arrays.
----> NumPy provides the in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

-- Nowadays, NumPy in combination with SciPy and Mat-plotlib is used as the replacement to MATLAB as Python is more complete and easier programming language than MATLAB.

-- Create NumPy Arrays ----> import numpy as np

-- NumPy Array Axis ----> A NumPy multi-dimensional array is represented by the axis where axis-0 represents the columns and axis-1 represents the rows. We can mention the axis to perform row-level or column-level calculations like the addition of row or column elements.
