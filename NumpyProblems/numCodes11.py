# Finding square root and standard deviation
'''The sqrt() and std() functions associated with the numpy array are used to find the square root and standard deviation of the array elements respectively. Standard deviation means how much each element of the array varies from the mean value of the numpy array.'''

import numpy as np  
a = np.array([[1,2,30],[10,15,4]])  

print(np.sqrt(a))  
print(np.std(a))
