# Arithmetic operations on the array -- The numpy module allows us to perform the arithmetic operations on  multi-dimensional arrays directly.

import numpy as np  
a = np.array([[1,2,30],[10,15,4]])  
b = np.array([[1,2,3],[12, 19, 29]])  

print("Sum of array a and b\n",a+b)  
print("Product of array a and b\n",a*b)  
print("Division of array a and b\n",a/b)
