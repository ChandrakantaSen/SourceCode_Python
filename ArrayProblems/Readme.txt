# The Array is a process of memory allocation. It is performed as a dynamic memory allocation.

# The Array is an idea of storing multiple items of the same type together, making it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to the base value.

# A combination of the arrays could save a lot of time by reducing the overall size of the code. It is used to store multiple values in a single variable.

# The Array can be handled in Python by a module named Array. It is useful when we must manipulate only specific data values -
    -- Element - Each item stored in an array is called an element.
    -- Index - The location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the      element's position. The index value is very much important in an Array.

# Some of the basic operations supported by an array are as follows -
    -- Traverse - It prints all the elements one by one.
    -- Insertion - It adds an element at the given index.
    -- Deletion - It deletes an element at the given index.
    -- Search - It searches an element using the given index or by the value.
    -- Update - It updates an element at the given index.
